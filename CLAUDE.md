# Cleo Prototype Template

## Project context

This is a prototype scaffolding tool for Cleo's product design team. Prototypes built from this template are rendered inside a simulated iPhone viewport and are used to test interaction patterns and product ideas with users. The design system under `src/design-system/` is a web translation of Cleo's Cocoa design system from the React Native app — tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, motion, gradients) and components map 1:1 where possible, with iOS interaction patterns approximated using Framer Motion.

## Design System Rules

These rules are non-negotiable and apply to every file you create or modify.

1. **Never hardcode values.** Do not hardcode hex colour values, pixel sizes, font names, font weights, or spacing values anywhere in the codebase. Every value must come from the design system.

2. **Always import from the design system.** When using tokens, import from `src/design-system/tokens`. When using components, import from `src/design-system/components`. Check whether a component already exists before building a new one.

3. **Check before building.** Before creating any UI element, check `src/design-system/components/` to see if a matching component already exists. If it does, use it. If one partially matches, extend it rather than duplicating it.

4. **Token usage in Tailwind.** Design tokens are available as Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-brown-50`, `bg-primary` for the semantic background role, `text-primary` for semantic content, `rounded-CARD`, `rounded-BUTTON`, `p-S`, `p-M`, `font-body`). Prefer these over inline styles where possible.

5. **No external component libraries.** Do not install or use component libraries such as shadcn/ui, Radix, MUI, Chakra, or similar. All UI must come from the design system in this repo or be built from scratch using the design system tokens.

6. **iOS interaction patterns.** All interactive elements must feel iOS-native:
   - Pressable elements use Framer Motion `whileTap={{ scale: 0.97 }}` for touch feedback.
   - Navigation transitions: push = slide from right, modal = slide from bottom.
   - Bottom sheets animate up from below using Framer Motion `AnimatePresence`.
   - Haptic equivalents are visual (scale, opacity shift) — not literal haptics.

7. **Safe area awareness.** Any element that would sit behind the Dynamic Island or home indicator on a real device must respect `SAFE_AREA_TOP` and `SAFE_AREA_BOTTOM` from `src/shell/SafeAreaProvider.tsx`, or wrap content in the `SafeArea` component from `src/design-system/components/SafeArea`.

## Workflow: Figma to Prototype

When a designer provides a Figma file or Figma MCP output:

1. Render the screen visually as provided in the Figma spec.
2. After rendering, perform a reconciliation pass:
   a. For every colour value in the Figma spec, check whether it matches a token in `src/design-system/tokens/colors.ts`. If it matches (exact or near-exact), replace the hardcoded value with the token reference.
   b. For every UI element in the Figma spec, check whether a matching component exists in `src/design-system/components/`. If it does, replace the raw implementation with the component.
3. Do not silently skip reconciliation. If a colour or element could not be matched, leave a comment in the code: `// No design system match found for [value/element] — using raw value`.
4. The output should be a screen that looks identical to the Figma spec but is built on design system primitives wherever possible.

## Workflow: Idea to Prototype

When a designer describes what they want in natural language:

1. Generate the UI using design system components and tokens exclusively. Do not invent visual decisions.
2. If the design system does not have a component for something, build it from scratch using only tokens — not arbitrary values.
3. Follow iOS interaction patterns as described in the Design System Rules section.
4. Structure output as one file per screen in `src/prototype/screens/`.
5. If the designer asks for navigation or linking between screens, implement it using React Router with screen transitions appropriate to the navigation type (push or modal).

## Prototype Structure

- One file per screen in `src/prototype/screens/`.
- Prototype-specific components (not from the design system) go in `src/prototype/components/`.
- Do not put prototype logic inside design system files.
- For routing between screens, use React Router. Push navigation slides from right. Modal navigation slides from bottom.
- Prototypes can be as simple or as complex as needed. Simple three-screen flows and full vision prototypes with branching logic are both valid uses of this template.

## What Not To Do

- Do not install new npm packages without being asked.
- Do not modify files in `src/design-system/` unless explicitly asked to update the design system.
- Do not use `any` in TypeScript.
- Do not create global CSS overrides that could break design system component styles.
- Do not use `px` values directly in component code — use spacing tokens.
